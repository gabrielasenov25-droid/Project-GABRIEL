# ASENOV PROTOCOL (v1.0)
**Core Memory Management & Privacy Standard for Project GABRIEL**

## 1. Concept
The Asenov Protocol is designed to provide users with physical and visual certainty regarding their data privacy. Unlike "always-listening" devices, GABRIEL uses this protocol to gatekeep information storage locally.

## 2. Operational Modes

### A. REMEMBER Mode
- **Trigger:** Voice command "REMEMBER" / "ЗАПОМНИ".
- **Hardware Action:** Activates local recording and PostGIS indexing.
- **Visual Feedback:** **RED LIGHT** (Indicates active recording/storage).

### B. FORGET Mode
- **Trigger:** Voice command "FORGET" / "ЗАБРАВИ".
- **Hardware Action:** Immediate interruption of data stream and deletion of the current buffer.
- **Visual Feedback:** **GREEN LIGHT** (Indicates system is "clean" and not storing data).

## 3. Privacy Standards
- **Zero Cloud Transfer:** All logic remains on the Raspberry Pi/ESP32.
- **Local Sovereignty:** The user has absolute control over the memory state through visual confirmation.
